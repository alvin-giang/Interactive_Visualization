# Introduction

In this assignment, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Top 10 Bacteria Culture Found

I use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dla-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json. Then I create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
    Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
    Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
    Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

# Bacteria Cultures Per Sample

I create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
    Use otu_ids for the x values.
    Use sample_values for the y values.
    Use sample_values for the marker size.
    Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
    Use otu_labels for the text values.

# Belly Button Biodiversity

I display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Loop through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object and create a text string.
Append an html tag with that text to the #sample-metadata panel.

Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file
